Data Structures and Libraries Problems
==============

Although a data structure does not in itself solve a problem -- the algorithm operating on it does -- using an appropriately efficient data structure for a problem may be the difference between passing or exceeding the problem's time limit.

Some of the topics touched in this chapter are:

* 1D Array Manipulation
* 2D Array Manipulation
* Java Collections
* Bit Manipulation
* LinkedList
* Stack
* TreeMap
* TreeSet
* PriorityQueue
* Graph Data Structures
* Union-Find Disjoint Sets
* Tree-related Data Structures
